A package that provides a friendly Dart API for accessing gamepads connected to a Windows machine.

This package builds on top of the Dart [win32](https://pub.dev/packages/win32)
package, offering a high-level Dart wrapper that avoids the need for users
to understand FFI or write directly to the Win32 API.
